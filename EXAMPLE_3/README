Synopsis
./rhadamanthus.pl

This example directory exhibits some
of the more advanced plotting features of
RHADAManTHUS, especially with regards to
the functional combination of analyses on
distinct production event channels or
final state event topologies.

Several example ".cut" statistics
output files precomputed by AEACuS are
provided in this case, and stored under
the ./Cuts/ directory.  The simulated
events present consist of SM ttbar
backgrounds, and a BSM SUSY model with
long chain squark->gluino->stop cascade
decays at various M_1/2, including
SS, SG, GG production with inclusive
production of initial state jets.

The controlling card file "plt_card.dat"
is stored inside the ./Cards/ directory,
and is independently commented.  It references
statistics computed by a prior offline run
of AEACuS, as requested by corresponding
"cut_card.dat" files (not provided).

To generate plots, simply run "./rhadamanthus.pl".
An output directory ./Plots/ will be created to
store the results, which may be compared against
reference figures in the ./Plots_REF directory.
Allow several minutes for execution, due to
processing of sizable statistical samples.

Note that "rhadamanthus.pl" requires inclusion
of "aeacus.pl" in the same directory as a
subroutine library, even if the latter is not
invoked directly.
