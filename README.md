AEACuS (Algorithmic Event Arbiter and Cut Selector)
computes event statistics
and performs event selection cuts
on event files in the .lhco format.

RHADAManTHUS (Recursively Heuristic Analysis, Display,
and Manipulation: The Histogram Utility Suite)
does automated plotting
of statistics computed by AEACuS.

Enter EXAMPLE directories for
four quick-start tutorials, including
sample card files for both programs.

Please contact the author directly
( Joel Walker <jwalker@shsu.edu> )
with any questions, comments, requests,
or invitations to present a talk.

Both programs are included in this
directory, and will run without
installation or use of any external
libraries on any linux based system
(including MacOSX) with Perl 5.8+.
Windows users may also have success,
but this is not officially supported.

A sampe card file representing most
of the statistics that AEACuS can
compute is in the ./Cards/ directory.

A manual for an older version
of AEACuS is available here:
http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3383
Note that several newer features are
not described, and that certain aspects
of the interface have changed.  Most
critically, program invocation is now:
./aeacus.pl card_file lhco_file cross_section_pb

Slides from a talk on AEACuS and RHADAManTHUS at the 2016 CERN
"(Re)interpreting the results of new physics searches at the LHC" workshop are
included with the package distribution, and also available
[online.](https://indico.cern.ch/event/571190/contributions/2377484/attachments/1387477/2112084/AEACuS_RHADAManTHUS_CERN.pdf)

Full documentation will
be forthcoming on the arXiv
at a later date.
