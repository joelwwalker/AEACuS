#! Prefered Fortran Compiler
#! If None: try to find g77 or gfortran on the system
#!
# fortran_compiler = None

#! Prefered Text Editor
#!  Default: use the shell default Editor
#!           or try to find one available on the system
#!  Be careful: Only shell based editor are allowed
# text_editor = None

#! Prefered WebBrower
#! If None: try to find one available on the system
# web_browser = None

#! Prefered PS viewer
#! If None: try to find one available on the system
# eps_viewer = None

#! Time allowed to answer question (if no answer takes default value)
#! 0: No time limit
# timeout = 60

#! Pythia8 Path.
#! Define the path to the pythia8 directory.
#! relative path start from mg5 directory
# pythia8_path = ./pythia8

#! Control when MG5 checks if he is up-to-date.
#! Enter the number of day between two check (0 means never)

################################################################################
# If this file is in a MADEVENT Template. 'main directory' is the directory
# containing the SubProcesses directory. Otherwise this is the madgraph5 main
# directory (containing the directories madgraph and Template)

#! Allow/Forbid the automatic opening of the web browser  (on the status page)
#!when launching MadEvent [True/False]
# automatic_html_opening = True

#! Default Running mode 
#! 0: single machine/ 1: cluster / 2: multicore
# run_mode = 2

#! Cluster Type [pbs|sge|condor|lsf|ge|slurm] Use for cluster run only
#! And cluster queue
#cluster_type = condor
# cluster_queue = madgraph

#! Path to a node directory to avoid direct writting on the central disk
#!Note that condor cluster avoid direct writting by default (therefore this
#!options didn't modify condor cluster)
# cluster_temp_path = None

#! How to deal with failed submission (can occurs on cluster mode)
#! 0: crash, -1: print error, hangs the program up to manual instructions, N(>0) retry up to N times.
# cluster_nb_retry = 1
#! How much time to wait for the output file before resubmission/crash (filesystem can be very slow)
# cluster_retry_wait = 300

#! Nb_core to use (None = all) This is use only for multicore run
#! This correspond also to the number core used for code compilation for cluster mode
# nb_core = None
