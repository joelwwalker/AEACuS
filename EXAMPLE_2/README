Synopsis:
./bin/internal/aeacus.pl
./bin/internal/rhadamanthus.pl

This example is set within the context
of a standard MadGraph run directory.

The scripts aeacus.pl and rhadamanthus.pl
have been placed into the ./bin/internal
directory, and corresponding cards with default
names, i.e. "cut_card.dat" and "plt_card.dat"
[ NB: NOT plot_card.dat ] have been placed
into the ./Cards directory and indvidually
commented.  When run with no lhco_file
parameter, the default operation of AEACuS
is to process all suitable .lhco files in
the local ./Events/ directory.  A typical
MadGraph process may generate several such
.lhco files within run_NN_N subdirectories,
corresponding to multiple runs, and/or
operation in batch mode.  AEACuS automatically
extracts the relevant cross section data and
merges event files with identical tags into
batches of fixed size (500,000 events by default).
It then applies any primary and auxiliary
event selections and statistical computations
specified in the invoked card_file.

To run the AEACuS example in the current
directory, execute "./bin/interna/aeacus.pl".
The ./Events/ folder contains four batches
of ttbar + 0-2 Jets inclusive background
samples, nominally containing 1,000 events
each (reduced by about 20% after matching)
in files named "LMNW_pgs_events.lhco.gz".
The .gz compression is unpacked internally
as these files are read.  The cut_card in
use specifies a merged file event cap of
2000 in order to exhibit the feature.
After running, there should be two merged
.lhco files in the ./Events/ directory
with sequentially numbered file names.
A new directory ./Cuts/ should also be
created, which holds two processed .cut
output files corresponding to each of the
input .lhco event files.  Statistics
requested by the example cut_card include
a count of jets and bjets, as well as a
count of light isolated leptons, the
transverse momentum of the leading pair
of jets, the missing transverse energy
(with a soft cut of 50 GeV applied), the
MET-Jet Minimal Delta Phi separation, the
MET / Sqrt(HT) signficance, and the massless
symmetric MT2 statistic with Lund hemisphere
pseudojets.  Additionally, auxilliary channel
filtering is requested for exclusive groupings
of 0, 1, or 2+ leptons, along with 2+, 1+ or 0+
B-Jets respectively, and the corresponding
output .cut files are placed underneath ./Cuts/
within subdirectories.

To run the RHADAManTHUS example in the current
directory, execute "./bin/internal/rhadamanthus.pl".
The example plt_card in use requests the
generation of four plots that graphically exhibit
various features of the statistical computation
performed by AEACuS.  These plots will be appear in 
a newly created directory ./Plots/ after successful
execution of the script, and may be compared against
reference figures in the ./Plots_REF directory.
