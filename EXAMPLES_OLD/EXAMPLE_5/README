Synopsis
./minos.pl

This example introduces the training 
of a Boosted Decision Tree for
discrimination of signal from background.

Several example ".cut" statistics
output files precomputed by AEACuS are
provided in this case, and stored under
the ./Cuts/ directory.

The controlling card file "min_card.dat"
is stored inside the ./Cards/ directory,
and is independently commented.

The AEACuS card "cut_card.dat" used to produce 
the .cut files is also provided for reference.

To generate training and associated plots,
simply run "./minos.pl".
An output directory ./Models/ will be created to
store the two sets of training, one with supplemental
event selections (TRN_001) and one without (TRN_011).

Note that "minos.pl" requires inclusion
of "aeacus.pl" in the same directory as a
subroutine library, even if the latter is not
invoked directly.

When executed it will merge the requested
features into a subdirectory ./CSV/ of each training,
correctly combining event weights.

MInOS additionally requires the installation
of MatPlotLib, and XGBoost for Python3.
If you do not have these packages then
the BDT script "minos.py" will be copied
into each training directory inside Models
but it will not be run.  Once this script
is run it will place the generated plots
into a further subdirectory ./Plots
