Synopsis
./rhadamanthus.pl

This example introduces the plotting of
two-dimensional histograms (heat maps).

Several example ".cut" statistics
output files precomputed by AEACuS are
provided in this case, and stored under
the ./Cuts/ directory.

The controlling card file "plt_card.dat"
is stored inside the ./Cards/ directory,
and is independently commented.

To generate plots, simply run "./rhadamanthus.pl".
An output directory ./Plots/ will be created to
store the results, which may be compared against
reference figures in the ./Plots_REF directory.
Allow several minutes for execution, due to
processing of sizable statistical samples.

Note that "rhadamanthus.pl" requires inclusion
of "aeacus.pl" in the same directory as a
subroutine library, even if the latter is not
invoked directly.
